### About Me

Hello! My name is Laasya and I am a highschooler from Minnesota. I have a passion for math and computer science; I am especially interested in the topics where the two fields intersect like machine learning, cryptology, and coding theory. I am currently [dual enrolled](https://ccaps.umn.edu/post-secondary-enrollment-options-pseo?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=C4245F0759D64BEC8FFD7236005C7765) at the University of Minnesota where I have taken courses like [MATH 5251 - Error-Correcting Codes, Finite Fields, Algebraic Curves](https://onestop2.umn.edu/pcas/viewCatalogCourse.do?courseId=004201). I like to read Jane Austen, Oscar Wilde, Marcus Zusak, and YA fiction. I also like to make jewelry and go on bike rides when I can (six months of Minnesota winter leaves behind mounds of snow, black ice, an immeasureable amount of slush). My friends and I play video games like Minecraft and Valorant together whenever we can.
