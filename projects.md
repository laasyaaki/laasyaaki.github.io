# Projects/Internships/Research!

## CMUEats

I am currently a tech lead of [CMUEats](https://cmueats.com), CMU's student-run, one stop shop for all dining information. This team is part CMU ScottyLabs and CMUEats is the club's most widely used web app. I am currently adding the ability of students to pin their favorite locations and hide the ones they don't want to see, all using their browser's local storage. Future features include a review system, filtering by dietary restrictions, and integrating the different locations menus into the main site. 

## TechnovationMN 2024

[Technovation Girls](https://technovationchallenge.org/) is an app-building contest where teams create an app to solve a problem. This competition also ties in a business aspect where teams have to create a pitch video along with the app. My team, Diabuddies, created a bloog sugar management app specifically targeted towards children. The features included a game to learn more about diabetes, an info page with different quizzes and challenges, a blood sugar level tracker, and a tree which grew based on points earned for interacting with the app and having healthy glucose levels. Our project was a winning app this year.

## CODEify 
[CODEify website](https://code-ify.org/)

I co-founded CODEify to make coding education accessible and inspire a love of technology in young children. We want to increase the representation of women, racial minorities, and other marginzalized groups in technology. We have worked with other non-profits like the Minnesota Technological Association, the JP4 Foundation, and the Minnesota Institute for Nigerian Development. As part of this organization I have tutored some of the coding classes we offer, written blogs, and promoted our mission within different communities. I have also helped develop our curriculum (Java, ML/AI) and I developed our website.

## TechnovationMN 2023

[Technovation Girls](https://technovationchallenge.org/) is an app-building contest where teams create an app to solve a problem. This competition also ties in a business aspect where teams have to create a pitch video along with the app. My team, Team Velocity, is creating an app to identify diseases in crops using machine learning. A user takes a picture of a crop and our app will identify the disease (or if it is healthy) based on a classification performed by our machine learning model. Our project was a winning app this year.

## Modeling the Future 2022-2023 - Competition
[Click here for our research paper.](https://laasyaaki.github.io/Spotting%20Melanoma.pdf)

[Modeling the Future](https://www.mtfchallenge.org/how-it-works/) is an actuarial math modeling contest where teams answer questions based on a scenario and dataset. The team also creates a project proposal for a data analysis research project. If selected as semi-finalists, the team will go on to create the project outlined in their proposal. My team, the Significant Errors, made it to semi-finalists and we research rising rates of melanoma cancer in Americans. We used SEER data to make predictions about future melanoma incidence rate trends and issued recommendations to combat this problem.
