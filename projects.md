## Modeling the Future 2022-2023 - Competition
[Click here for our research paper.](https://lysol-soap.github.io/Spotting%20Melanoma.pdf)

[Modeling the Future](https://www.mtfchallenge.org/how-it-works/) is an actuarial math modeling contest where teams answer questions based on a scenario and dataset. The team also creates a project proposal for a data analysis research project. If selected as semi-finalists, the team will go on to create the project outlined in their proposal. My team, the Significant Errors, made it to semi-finalists and we reserach rising rates of melanoma cancer in Americans. We used SEER data to make predictions about future melanoma incidence rate trends and issued recommendations to combat this problem. 

## Technovation 2023 - Competition
*In progress - no link available currently*

[Technovation Girls](https://technovationchallenge.org/) is an app-building contest where teams create an app to solve a problem. This competition also ties in a business aspect where teams have to create a pitch video along with the app. My team, Team Velocity, is creating an app to identify diseases in crops using machine learning. A user takes a picture of a crop and our app will identify the disease (or if it is healthy) based on a classification performed by our machine learning model. 

## Wordle Clone - School Project 
[Link to github repo.](https://github.com/lysol-soap/wordle_clone)

Through PSEO, I am taking [CSCI 1913 - Introduction to Algorithms, Data Structures, and Program Development](https://onestop2.umn.edu/pcas/viewCatalogCourse.do?courseId=809667). Our first project was to create a clone of the game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) using python. This project proved to be trickier than I thought it would be. While the concept of the game was simple, developing an algorithm for certain parts was a learning expirience. Including special cases for words with duplicate letters was probably the hardest part. I learned more about program flexibility from this project. 

## AP Computer Science Principles Create Task
