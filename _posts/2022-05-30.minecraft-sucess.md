It is difficult to find a video game that has been able to maintain its immense success for such a long period of time. One of the only games that has been able to do this is the sandbox video game Minecraft. Created by Markus Persson, also known as Notch, and Mojang Studios, the game has sold 238 million copies (making it the most sold video game) since its official release in 2011. The game has gone through many different updates since the initial release with some changing the rudimentary frameworks of the game while still maintaining a loyal fanbase. Why has this game become so popular and how does it remain so?

First of all, Minecraft was released at a time when many video games were lacking unique elements and felt like copy-paste projects. A game that was nothing like anything ever made was released and many were intrigued by it. The Minecraft graphics in 2011 were seen as low quality and outdated, yet many purchased the game to try to understand what the objective was. 

The “official” objective of the game is to travel to The End, a dimension where the final boss, The Ender Dragon, resides. However, to play the game, completing the main objective isn’t necessary at all. Players can build and destroy everything in the world which allows infinite creativity. As the game received more positive feedback, it kept evolving. Soon a creative mode was added where the player could just build using infinite resources without having to collect them beforehand. And even after players complete the main objective of the game, their Minecraft world has infinite terrain waiting to be explored and more difficult objectives to complete. 

Through Minecraft people are able to interact with each other in multiplayer worlds. This has resulted in different Minecraft servers being turned into commercial successes and some being able to earn their livelihood solely due to the game. The game already has so many elements that set it apart from other games on the market and appeals to a very large group of people. As one of the most popular games ever created, Minecraft becomes even greater every day.
