Due to the growing concern about our planet’s safety and climate change, many companies have pledged to become more environmentally friendly in the coming years. This includes the technology industry who has been responsible for 2.1 to 3.9 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions which is over 900 million metric tons (1). However, even as many companies in the tech industry have adopted more sustainable practices, consumers are a different story. Once a device, such as a computer, is purchased, the company cannot regulate the consumer’s usage. One computer left on for 24 hours a day will dump around 1,500 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A tree absorbs between 3 - 15 lbs of carbon dioxide each year. That means that 100 - 500 trees would be needed to offset the yearly emissions of one computer that is left on all the time (2). 

Today, many people have at least one computer per family and each individual has a laptop. Many offices and schools issue laptops, tablets, and/or phones to employees and students. The technology industry is producing more devices than ever before and at a faster rate. While many new technologies like smart home products reduce the carbon footprint of a home, this effort is being offset by the emissions of an increased number of computers. In recent years, large-scale computing has become more popular. Whether this type of computing is being utilized by a physicist conducting simulations or a cryptocurrency mining facility, it contributes to the global greenhouse emissions (3). 

Another concern is the disposal of old devices, also referred to as e-waste. While some cities possess a means to safely dispose of e-waste, many residents dispose of technology with the rest of their trash. Many old devices end up in landfills, contributing to the global trash problem. If residents recycled old devices, batteries, and computers, new devices utilizing these old materials would reduce the waste and be cheaper to produce. However, some areas do not provide a method to recycle old devices, so residents of these areas have no choice. 

In conclusion, while the technology industry makes an effort to evolve into a more sustainable industry, the consumers must do their part as well. Consumers must be mindful of their computer usage and recycle their e-waste properly.
