Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source that harnesses the Earth’s heat. It is a small industry, but it is very important where it matters. This type of energy can be better for our warming planet. Geothermal energy can be used for ground source heat pumps, and it has a higher heating efficiency among its many benefits. Geothermal energy could be a big part of the clean-energy future.

In Arvada, Colorado, the Geos Neighborhood is one of the greenest and most energy efficient in the US. The designer, Norbert Klebl, implements solar panels on the rooftops of the houses and energy efficient laundry machines. Also, Klebl uses multi-paned windows for insulation and includes electric vehicle charging stations. The homes in this neighborhood also made use of geothermal heat pumps. “The core of the earth is the same temperature of the surface of the sun. Geothermal takes advantage of the fact that the warmth of the core of the earth radiates up to the surface. If you drill six or seven feet down, the temperature is pretty steady during the year. It’s steady here at 57 degrees Fahrenheit. You can use that as a reservoir for both heating in the winter and cooling your house in the summer,” said Geos Neighborhood resident Dar Lon Chang (1). Traditional heating and cooling units cost less to install, which means that this option attracts more people. But, if the right people become involved, like the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, geothermal heating and cooling could become a more widespread option. Geothermal heating is more efficient, quiet, durable, safe, and helps conserve limited natural resources.

However, harnessing geothermal energy has some disadvantages as well. While it has a large potential, it can be location specific. Also, the renewability and sustainability of this option relies on the reservoirs being properly managed which will be more expensive. While geothermal energy reduces carbon emissions overall, drilling down into the earth’s surface can release greenhouse gases trapped below the surface. But, if carefully considered and implemented, it can be a viable option.

Rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially methane, is the key to tackling climate change. Around 30% of all greenhouse gases are produced by houses. Energy-clean homes, along with electric cars, are necessary to reduce our carbon footprint. This neighborhood is a good example of how future housing projects can implement clean energy solutions and help the environment.
