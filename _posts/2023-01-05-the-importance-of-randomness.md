According to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary, randomness is defined as the quality of being or seeming to lack a definite plan, purpose, or pattern (1). Depending on the context, randomness can be viewed positively or negatively. Though, the randomness experienced in everyday life is not truly random. The human brain cannot truly generate random ideas or numbers. When asked, the “random” numbers that humans have are ones that have been in the back of their brains or previously thought of. So, the task of generating random numbers was bestowed upon computers. 

### Computer Generated Randomness

Computers execute tasks and algorithms because some human programmed them to. Machines can be instructed to generate “random” numbers, but these numbers aren’t truly random because the same algorithm is used to generate them. The program starts with a “seed” number, or a number that marks the beginning of a pattern (2). The pattern of numbers produced by the computer may be long and not be easily discernible due to a carefully developed algorithm, but there is a pattern nevertheless. These numbers are called “pseudo-random” numbers (2). These numbers are random enough for many purposes. For example, polling certain residents in an area using computer generated numbers will suffice. 

### True Randomness

Achieving true randomness is incredibly difficult. Even a normal coin or a regular six-sided die aren’t completely fair. If one of the coins buried in someone’s pocket is flipped, there's a 51% chance of the coin landing on the side that was face up before thrown up in the air. The six-sided die found in a board game is more of a rectangular prism; the lengths of sides differ in only fractions of millimeters. This might not seem important, flipping a coin or rolling a die once or twice produces fair enough results. Flipping a coin a million times gives around a 490,000 to 510,000 ratio of sides.  

There are only certain computers and algorithms that can theoretically generate truly random numbers. They depend upon randomly occurring natural phenomena, like atmospheric noise, not human-defined algorithms. Even these algorithms can technically only generate true random numbers in theory. The outputs could still be biased towards even numbers or larger numbers (2). 

### The Importance of Randomness

The significance of randomness is severely underestimated. 

Random numbers are generated for polls, games, and more. For example, poker is a game that relies on randomly dealt hands. Using a human-defined algorithm to deal cards on an online poker site means that the pattern can be cracked. Programs that predict the card dealings can be written and cheating would corrupt the site. Reverse engineering these algorithms would be prevented with the use of truly random numbers. But, losing money isn’t the only reason truly random numbers are necessary. 

The “strong” and “secure” password generator that many establishments use rely on randomly generated characters. If the algorithm that generates these passwords is cracked, an ocean of data would be compromised. Today's hashes may be unbreakable for now, but eventually will be cracked (like the all previously “unbreakable” codes). Cryptography requires numbers that cannot be cracked (4). Important government messages or messages containing your personal data are encrypted when delivered to the recipient. If the encryption can be cracked, blood types, credit card information, and social security numbers could be leaked. True randomly generated numbers would have no algorithm, and thus couldn’t be cracked in any other way than a lucky guess. 

### Conclusion

Randomness is useful, whether it falls under pseudo-randomness or true randomness. Determining what residents of an area think about a new tax, or encrypting and protecting important data, requires randomness. True randomness might be almost impossible to achieve, but the need for it is immense.
