[Reshma Saujani - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reshma_Saujani)

Reshma Saujani is a visionary leader, author, and advocate for women in technology. She is best known as the founder of Girls Who Code, an organization that has revolutionized the landscape of female participation in the tech industry.

Saujani's journey started with a realization that girls, too, could thrive in the world of technology. This led her to establish Girls Who Code in 2012, with the mission of closing the gender gap in technology and empowering young women to pursue careers in the field. The organization has since impacted the lives of thousands of girls, providing them with the skills, resources, and confidence to break through the barriers that have historically hindered their participation in STEM fields.

Saujani's commitment to challenging the status quo extends beyond Girls Who Code. In her book "Brave, Not Perfect," she encourages women to embrace imperfection and take risks, arguing that a fear of failure often holds them back from reaching their full potential. Through personal anecdotes and empowering narratives, Saujani inspires readers to redefine success, creating a culture that values bravery and resilience over perfection.

As a former Deputy Public Advocate for New York City and the first South Asian woman to run for Congress in the United States, Saujani has always been at the forefront of advocating for social and political change. Her advocacy extends to issues like immigration, education, and economic inequality, reflecting her commitment to creating a more inclusive and equitable society.

Her impact is not limited to the United States; it is heard globally. Through her tireless efforts and advocacy, she has become a symbol of empowerment for women worldwide, demonstrating that it is never too late to challenge societal norms and strive for greatness. Her work has earned her accolades, including being named one of Fortune's World's Greatest Leaders and TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential People. Through Girls Who Code and her advocacy efforts, Saujani has not only transformed the lives of countless young women but has also paved the way for a more inclusive, diverse, and innovative future.
