An operating system is a major piece of software that runs on a computer that manages all of the computer’s other software, hardware, memory, and processes. Using the operating system, you can communicate with your computer and control it. An operating system is what makes a computer as we know it and without one, our computer would not serve the purpose we need it to. The operating systems that we are most familiar with use different graphical user interfaces or GUIs which allow us to interact with our machines. A GUI uses windows, buttons, menus, and more and displays everything on your screen using images and text. Each operating system has its own unique GUI. There are numerous operating systems and anyone can create their own. The ones we are most familiar with are Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS.



### Windows
The Microsoft Windows operating system was created in the 1980s and there have been many renditions from Windows 95 in 1995 to Windows 11 in 2021. The operating system is automatically downloaded onto all Microsoft computers. Microsoft Windows dominates the computer industry making up around 75% of all desktop computers. Because a majority of the market is made up of Windows, it is easier to obtain parts and help for this operating system. Also, this operating system is popular because of its simple GUI. While many of the major operating systems have updated their GUI to be more user friendly, Windows remains the most accessible. The operating system is also convenient for both touch screen users and non-touch screen users. Windows is an optimal operating system from a programming standpoint as well. Many other operating systems do not allow users to create windowed applications and do not provide the same level of functionality that Windows provides. 

However, while Windows has many advantages, it also has its disadvantages. First, the operating system is not as secure as it is made out to be and programmers can break the measures put in place easily. As Windows updates its operating system, users are not automatically in sync with the latest version. This allows attackers to target those who have not yet installed the latest update and still possess the old version with its bugs. Also, many components must be paid for and buying an entire duplicate operating system costs a lot unlike other operating systems which are open source (software for which the original source code is freely available). While Windows has different disadvantages, every other operating system does as well. 



### macOS
Apple’s macOS is an operating system installed on Apple computers. The first Apple computer was created in 1976 and macOS was created in 2001. While the computer market is dominated by Microsoft Windows, the cellphone and tablet market is dominated by Apple IOS. One of the main selling points of macOS is that IOS devices may be connected and content may be synced. If a user is experienced with IOS, the GUI of macOS is simple to master. Also, macOS has a single update mechanism that takes care of all programs, applications, and other components of the computer unlike other operating systems. Compared to Windows, macOS is less susceptible to different malware and viruses. 

While many applications integrated into macOS are free, the actual device cost is very high. Another con of macOS is that you must own a Mac device to run it and doing so otherwise is illegal. The user also has limited upgrade options and flexibility in areas of software and hardware like gaming, applications in the store, CPU, and RAM. 



### Linux
Linux is an open source operating system that was created in 1991. There are many variations of Linux, called flavors, each suited for different purposes. Some of the most popular flavors are Android, Ubuntu, Debian, and Kali, each with their own skill sets. Out of the three operating systems discussed, Linux is the most secure and stable. In Linux, the security of the user is put first and is rarely susceptible to malware. While learning Linux takes some time, after mastering the basics, this system is easier and more practical to use than Windows or macOS. Linux also allows its users to have the utmost control over the software. 

Users can use any flavor of Linux they want to, but when faced with many options, an extra step of consideration is required. There is no standard edition of Linux and this makes troubleshooting more difficult. Also, Linux makes up a small portion of the market which means that many people are unfamiliar with the software. 



### Which One to Choose?
Choosing an operating system by weighing the pros and cons is important to get the best experience. There is no correct answer to this question. Based on what purpose you want your software to serve and your computer experience level, different operating systems will meet your needs. One way to try out different operating systems is to spin up a new virtual machine and explore the different features. Each operating system has its own advantages and disadvantages, but choosing one that best fits your needs is the key.
