Using technology, we have been able to communicate with others across the world. People that we usually have to travel hundreds or thousands of miles to talk to can be reached in less than a minute. We can talk to anybody at any time. This method of communication opens up a whole new world of possibilities. But this instant communication wasn’t always around. We used to have to send letters which could take up to months or years to deliver. How has digital technology affected human interaction?

The invention of the telephone was a game changer. While the earliest versions of the telephone had their own drawbacks, it definitely surpassed the telegrams. Telegrams were sent in morse code by an electrical telegraph. This design was only capable of transmitting short messages and took longer to reach the intended recipient. The telephone allowed longer messages to be transmitted over a shorter time. An added benefit to the telephone was the messages being transmitted over voice. The next large method of communication was email. This allowed people to send quick messages with ease. Then, the smartphone was invented and instant messaging was born. 

Instant messaging is the most used, fastest, and easiest way to communicate today. We can talk with family and friends who live across the world. Employees can contact colleagues who are miles and miles away. Another way of communication that is becoming more popular is VoIP (voice over IP) calls. VoIP allows us to make calls over internet connection instead of phone lines. This method of communication can be seen as an alternative to using a cell phone to talk. VoIP calls have been widely used in the pandemic in apps like Zoom or Discord.

There’s a new term called virtual distance. It describes people being physically together but on their devices while in the same room. This doesn’t just apply to one type of relationship. It’s been seen among friends, family, couples, and any other human interaction relationship. The interactions between human-to-human interactions are decreasing while human-to-machine and interactions are increasing. 

The presence of social media is increasing and comes with its own set of benefits and some drawbacks. It increases connectivity over long distances. But, it has gotten people fired from their jobs and ruined relationships. Problems like an extreme interest in one’s appearance and narcissism can stem from social media if used incorrectly. By this, I mean that some people use social media to display their popularity instead of forming new relationships and strengthening already existing ones. 

In conclusion, technology isn’t all bad. If used moderately, correctly, and responsibly, it can help strengthen relationships. Otherwise it can sever them. Whether it’s between a parent and child, couples, or anything else, the effects are still present. It’s important to remember how to interact without our devices and social media.
