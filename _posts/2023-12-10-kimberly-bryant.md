[Kimberly Bryant - MNCWIT](https://ncwit.org/profile/kimberly-bryant/)

Kimberly Bryant is the founder of Black Girls CODE and has dedicated her career to breaking down barriers and creating pathways for girls of color to thrive in the world of technology. Bryant's journey began when she noticed the lack of representation in the tech industry. Fueled by a passion for innovation and a commitment to addressing this disparity, she founded Black Girls CODE in 2011. The nonprofit organization aims to empower girls of color aged 7 to 17 by introducing them to the world of computer programming and technology.

The driving force behind Black Girls CODE is the belief that all girls, regardless of their background, should have equal opportunities to pursue careers in technology. Bryant recognized the importance of early exposure to coding and tech concepts, so, Black Girls CODE provides workshops, after-school programs, and summer camps to introduce girls to computer science in a fun and supportive environment. Black Girls CODE not only imparts technical skills but also fosters creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork. By providing access to technology and mentorship, the organization aims to equip girls with the tools they need to become future leaders and innovators in the tech industry.

Beyond teaching girls how to build their programming skills, Bryant's vision includes addressing the broader issue of representation. By showcasing successful women of color in tech as role models and mentors, Black Girls CODE helps to dismantle stereotypes and inspire young girls to pursue their passions. The impact of this approach extends beyond individual success stories, contributing to a more inclusive and diverse tech industry as a whole. Bryant's efforts have garnered recognition and many accolades and Black Girls CODE has expanded its reach globally, with chapters across the United States and in Johannesburg, South Africa, demonstrating the universality and urgency of the mission.

Through Black Girls CODE, Bryant is not only shaping the future for countless young girls but also reshaping the narrative around who belongs in the world of technology.
