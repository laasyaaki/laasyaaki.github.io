[Joy Buolamwini - Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJoy_Buolamwini&psig=AOvVaw2Nl3WxOvavCGddRFax2ofq&ust=1700074765831000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCKCO4paWxIIDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, Joy Buolamwini is a computer scientist, self-proclaimed code-poet, and activist who has become a prominent figure in the fight for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). Buolamwini gained widespread recognition through her groundbreaking work on bias in facial recognition technology. While working at the MIT Media Lab, she discovered that many commercially available facial recognition systems exhibited significant accuracy discrepancies across different demographic groups. What was even more alarming was the fact that these systems often performed poorly for individuals with darker skin tones and women. This finding led Buolamwini to spread awareness about and combat biases ingrained in AI algorithms.

In 2018, she founded the Algorithmic Justice League, a collective of activists and researchers dedicated to addressing bias and inequality in AI. The organization aims to raise awareness about the societal impacts of AI and advocates for accountability and transparency in the development and deployment of these technologies. Buolamwini's advocacy also extends into the realms of policy and education. She has been a vocal proponent of establishing regulations to govern the use of facial recognition technology and other AI systems. Her efforts have contributed to the growing conversation surrounding the ethical considerations of AI, prompting tech giants and policymakers to reassess their approaches.

As a testament to her impact, Buolamwini was named one of TIME magazine's 100 most influential people in 2019. Her work serves as a reminder that the development of technology should be guided by principles of fairness, accountability, and inclusivity. In a world where technology is increasingly integrated into every aspect of our lives, Joy Buolamwini's advocacy for ethical AI is a call to action. Her story inspires us to question the status quo, to challenge biases embedded in technology, and to work towards a future where AI benefits everyone, regardless of their background or identity.
