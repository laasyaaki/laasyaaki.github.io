We live in a world where 3D printers can create almost anything using non-organic materials, like plastic, concrete, or metal. Lately, 3D printers have been rising to prominence in the medical world. Medical facilities are able to precisely print their own tools with a complicated shape or a device that best fits a patient’s anatomy. Could 3D printing play a large part in the future of medicine?



### Tools and Devices
Hospitals and other medical facilities often buy completed equipment in bulk from third party sellers. However, 3D printing has allowed sellers and medical facilities to print their own tools. This method has been used to create many of the same devices, just like the original, non-3D printed tools. Going a step further, these 3D printers also allow custom made, patient-matched tools to be created.

These custom 3D printed tools have yet to become the norm in medical facilities. In the US, the FDA regulates generic 3D printed medical tools. These tools are evaluated based on safety and effectiveness, before they can enter the market. Custom medical tools are exempt from FDA review, based on federal law.



### Tissues, Organs, and Bones
Due to modern medicines and technologies, quality of medical care has vastly improved. The death rate from medical problems is decreasing and, as a result, there are less organs suitable for transplants. A solution to this problem would be 3D printing organs suitable for transplant, using organic materials. However, many biomaterials are difficult to work with because they collapse easily during printing, due to earth’s gravity. To solve this problem, scientists are turning toward space. The challenge of printing under gravity can be eliminated, and allow for organs that are more stable. Printing organs isn’t a theoretical concept, with many companies having successfully printed tissue. Though, we will have to wait at least 10 years before these organs can be used in transplants.



### Medicine
A new 3D printed drug called Spritam was approved by the FDA. A study by the University of Queensland has explored 3D printing pills. Similar to printing custom tools, these pills would be suited toward a certain patient based on their specific diagnosis. While there are still many challenges to work out, the concept could be life changing. Customizable pills will allow someone to take all of their medication in the exact right quantity, from one bottle.



### Conclusion
While 3D printing will take some time to become more mainstream in the medical world, these applications are game changers. Saving time, money, and energy increases efficiency and saves lives.
